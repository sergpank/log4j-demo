# Log4j2 + Slf4j Minimum Value Project

Created to use as a reference.

I always forget how to quickly add logging to some prototype.

Particilary minimum configuration file and dependencies.

And especially I hate fixing this error message:
```
Failed to load class org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder
```
